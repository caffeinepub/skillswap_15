  "summary": "The diff implements all six core requirements of the Skill Exchange Platform. REQ-1 through REQ-6 are addressed with backend Motoko actor, frontend React components, and a cohesive visual theme. However, a few specific acceptance criteria have gaps: the 'decline' action for exchange requests is not visible in the diff, the empty-search illustration asset usage is truncated/unclear, and the 'declined' state persistence on the backend is not confirmed. One minor hallucinated feature (a multi-step profile setup modal) goes slightly beyond spec but is benign.",
